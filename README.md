Explanation of Sender and Receiver:
	The programâ€™s main purpose is to depict shared memory and message queues between Sender (sender.cpp) and Receiver (recv.cpp). Shared memory enables information communication between processes by reading/writing data to/from a shared memory region. Message queue allows information communication between processes by exchanging messages utilizing a queue.
